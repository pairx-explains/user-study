    <h1>User Study for PAIR-X Visual Explanations - Giraffes</h1>
    <p>Thank you for your interest in our survey! We are evaluating a new explainability approach for deep animal re-identification models, and would love your input. The survey should take approximately 20 minutes to complete. Once you begin, we encourage you to complete it in one sitting, as your responses will be timed, and may not be saved between sessions. Your answers will remain anonymous, though we will collect some background information on your experience with giraffe re-identification to better understand our respondents. Thank you for your time and participation!<p>
